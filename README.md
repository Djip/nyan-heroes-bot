# Custom Discord Bot

Everyone gets to setup a "profile" which holds their blockchain wallet

Main course for this bot is to have different missions for different days. When people clear these missions, their wallet will be whitelisted in a document which admins can fetch for custom usages.

The bot includes commands, private messaging, mission questions, etc.
